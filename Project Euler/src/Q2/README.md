# Question

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Answer

- The program starts by initializing three variables: "prev" and "curr" are the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence, and "sum_even" is the sum of even-valued terms.

- While loop is used to generate the Fibonacci sequence.

- If the next term is even, it is added to "sum_even".
