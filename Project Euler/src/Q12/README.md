# Question

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Answer

- `n` is set to 1 to represent the index of the triangle number, tn is set to 1 to represent the current triangle number, `divisorCount` is set to 0 to represent the number of divisors, and i is declared as an integer for loop variables.
- The loop first calculates the next triangle number by incrementing `n` and adding it to `tn` , the `divisorCount` is then reset to 0 for the current triangle number `tn`.
- A for loop is used to iterate through each integer `i` up to the square root of `tn`, and check if it is a divisor of `tn` ; If `i` is a divisor, then `divisorCount` is incremented by 2, since every divisor `i` has a corresponding divisor `tn/i`. If `i` is a square root of `tn`, it is counted only once, so `divisorCount` is decremented by 1.
- Once the loop completes, the code checks whether the `divisorCount` is greater than 500. If not, it repeats the loop with the next triangle number.
